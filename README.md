# Movie Trailer Website

Download the Movie Trailer Website files from [this link](https://github.com/bhaskardua/FSWD-Project-1-Movie-Trailer-Website/archive/master.zip).

Unzip the downloaded files to a preferred location on your computer.

Make sure that you have Python downloaded on your computer. You may use Python 3, but keep in mind that this code was developed using Python 2 so there could be issues if Python 3 is used. You can download a version of Python suitable for your operating system from [this link](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

From the command line navigate to the folder where you unzipped the files and issue the following command:
 
 `python entertainment_center.py`

If all goes well a html file would be generated and the Movie Trailer Website would automatically open in a web browser. In case it does not then check for the **fresh_tomatoes.html** file and manually open it in a browser.
